// Project-page deployment: this app is served from

// the other framework variants. `basePath` prefixes `next/link` hrefs,
// `next/image` src, and Next's own /_next/* asset URLs automatically, but
// not hand-authored asset paths (the search.js <script> src, the favicon
// <link>, or the fetch()/import specifiers inside public/search.js itself)

// `output: "export"` + `trailingSlash: true` makes `next build` write plain
// static HTML/CSS/JS to out/ (each route as `<path>/index.html`), which is
// what a directory-listing static host like GitHub Pages needs — there is no
// Node server at runtime to fall back to. This is also why every dynamic
// route's generateStaticParams below must enumerate every path it wants
// built: `output: "export"` throws `Page "..." is missing
// "generateStaticParams()" so it cannot be used with "output: export"
// config.` for any dynamic route whose generateStaticParams resolves to zero
// entries (verified against packages/next/src/build/index.ts's
// `hasGenerateStaticParams` check, which is `prerenderedRoutes.length > 0`
// — an empty array trips the same throw as no function at all). See
// src/app/news/post/[id]/page.tsx for how the empty-collection case is
// handled.
